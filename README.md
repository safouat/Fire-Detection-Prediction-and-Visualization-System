# Fire-detection-with-alarm-and-sms-System
The code uses OpenCV and other libraries to implement a fire detection system. It captures video, applies image processing techniques like Gaussian blur and color conversion, detects fire based on color thresholds, and counts the occurrences. If fire is detected, it plays an alarm sound, sends SMS notifications, and updates a Telegram channel. The code utilizes threading for parallel execution and supports video streaming.
